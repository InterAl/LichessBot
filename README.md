# Docs 
I hate losing in Chess. Especially online. This program helps alleviate my pain a little bit.

# Usage
###Server:

Start as White:
```
$ node server w 
```

Start as Black:
```
$ node server b
```

###Client:
Just copy the content of client.js into your browser's console, inside the match-up window.

#Additional Remarks
* You must disable your browser's CORS policy in order for this to work.
  On Linux, run:
  ```
  $ google-chrome --disable-web-security
  ```
  On Windows it's a little bit more complicated (you need to create a shortcut or something), so Google it.

* Please do not use this program in ranked play, unless you're a cheap loser like me.
