# Docs 
I hate losing in Chess. Especially online. This program helps alleviate the pain a little bit.

# Usage
###Server:
```
$ node app w # start as white

$ node app b # start as black
```

###Client:
Just copy the client.js content into your browser's console, inside the match-up window.

#Additional remarks
Please do not use this program in ranked play, unless you're a cheap loser like me.
