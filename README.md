# Docs 
I hate losing in Chess. Especially online. This program helps alleviate the pain a little bit.

# Usage
###Server:

Start as white:
```
$ node app w 
```

Start as black:
```
$ node app b
```

###Client:
Just copy the content of client.js into your browser's console, inside the match-up window.

#Additional remarks
Please do not use this program in ranked play, unless you're a cheap loser like me.
