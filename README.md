# Docs 
I hate losing in Chess. Especially online. This program helps alleviate my pain a little bit.

# Usage
###Server:

Start as White:
```
$ node server w 
```

Start as Black:
```
$ node server b
```

###Client:
Just copy the content of client.js into your browser's console, inside the match-up window.

#Additional Remarks
Please do not use this program in ranked play, unless you're a cheap loser like me.
